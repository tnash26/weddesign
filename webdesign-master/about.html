                <p>If you take only one thing away from our website, make it this – you can (dramatically) improve your advertising and
                marketing performance by more accurately tracking every single strategy you employ – even if your only strategy is your
                website.
                </p>
                <p>
                When speaking to business owners and prospective customers, it’s quite common to hear them tell us that they already
                track everything by asking their prospective clients the infamous “How did you hear about us?” question. Hmmm. The
                problem with this approach is that the responses are inaccurate at best, and more often than not, downright misleading.
                Believe it – because we’ve tracked it and found that as many as 50% of the responses to that question are simply not
                true or accurate.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you take only two things away from visiting our website, make the second take-away the simple fact that you should be
                doing whatever you can to increase your company’s visibility on search engines such as Google. It’s a real estate game.
                It’s like the board game Monopoly. Visit Google and enter a keyword or keyword phrase that you think someone would use
                to find a business in your industry. If you don’t see your business at least 2 times on the first page, you are losing
                potential customers to your competitors. Period. The Internet is perhaps the most powerful and cost-effective sales and
                marketing tool at your disposal.
